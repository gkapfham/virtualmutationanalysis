# virtualmutationanalysis

This repository contains the replication package for a research paper that was accepted for publication at the [Eleventh
International Workshop on Automation of Software Test](http://tech.brookes.ac.uk/AST2016/) (AST 2016). In particular,
the repository contains an R package, written with the [devtools](http://github.com/hadley/devtools) package development
framework.

You are invited to use this repository 

If you find this example useful, could I trouble you to star this repository and then acknowledge it in your own
research efforts?  If you would like to learn more about my research program, then you can checkout my

Here is a reference for the paper:

> Phil McMinn, Gregory M. Kapfhammer, and Chris J. Wright.
> Virtual Mutation Analysis for Relational Database Schemas.
> 11th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test (AST 2016).
